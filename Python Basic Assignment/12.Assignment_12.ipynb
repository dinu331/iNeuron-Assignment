    "**Ans:** If a **`PdfFileReader`** object’s PDF is encrypted with the password **`swordfish`** and you're not aware of it. first read the Pdf using the PdfFileReader Class. PdfFileReader class provides a attribute called **`isEncrypted`** to check whether a pdf is encrypted or not. the method returns true if a pdf is encrypted and vice versa.  \n",
    "if pdf is encrypted use the **`decrypt()`** method provided by PdfFileReader class first then try to read the contents/pages of the pdf, else PyPDF2 will raise the following error **`PyPDF2.utils.PdfReadError: file has not been decrypted`**"

    "**Ans:** The structure of a document is represented by three different data types in **`python-Docx`**. At the highest level, a `Document` object represents the entire document. The Document object contains a list of **`Paragraph`** objects for the paragraphs in the document. (A new paragraph begins whenever the user presses `ENTER` or `RETURN` while typing in a Word document.) Each of these Paragraph objects contains a list of one or more **`Run`** objects.\n",

A Run object is a contiguous run of text with the same style. A new Run object is needed whenever the text style changes."
